<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Galatians</span>, vi., 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Bear ye one another&rsquo;s
burdens, and so fulfil the law of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are certain burdens which every man must bear for
himself, which none can bear for him.&nbsp; Such are the burdens
brought upon him by sin&mdash;fear, remorse, punishment.&nbsp;
Such again are the burdens of responsibility which belong to his
gifts and opportunities from <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Of these it is not the Divine
will that he should be relieved by others.&nbsp; Rightly is he
made to eat the fruit of his own wilful doings; rightly is he
accountable to <span class="smcap">God</span> for all that has
been lent to him, for all that he has been commanded to do.&nbsp;
It is true indeed that the co-operation or opposition of other
men may, in some measure, affect the bearing of these <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>burdens; but
still mainly, if not entirely, is it a question between
<i>him</i> and his <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;with
which a stranger intermeddleth not&mdash;what he shall suffer,
what reckoning shall be made with him: &ldquo;The son shall not
bear the iniquity of the father;&rdquo; &ldquo;Every man shall
receive his own reward according to his own work;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Every one of us shall give an account of <i>himself to</i>
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These burdens may be considered <i>appropriate</i> and
<i>peculiar</i> to the individual or class of individuals upon
whom they are laid: so that you may anticipate, almost with
certainty, the judgment which imposes them; may observe without
wonder or questioning who have to bear them; may trace back the
effect to its cause, the duty to its obligation, and justify and
approve the law of their imposition.</p>
<p>But there are other burdens which seem to light
&ldquo;hap-hazard&rdquo; upon their bearers, incurred by no
special misconduct, corresponding with no particular powers and
opportunities.&nbsp; There is no reason that can be discerned why
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span><i>these</i>
men should have them, and <i>those</i> be free from them.&nbsp;
Nay, there seems every reason why it should be otherwise: the
back is weak upon which the heavy weight is laid; the
understanding is simple which has perplexities to unravel; the
life is upright which has been afflicted; the hand is willing
which has no work to do.&nbsp; These are the burdens, the
&ldquo;heavy things,&rdquo; the <i>grievances</i> of which the
text speaks, burdens from beneath which the bearers may naturally
cry, &ldquo;Why am I thus?&rdquo; burdens the beholding whereof
from afar should prompt the humble, adoring exclamation,
&ldquo;Why am I <i>not</i> thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last part of the text answers both classes of
inquirers.&nbsp; It is, that opportunity may be afforded for
fulfilling &ldquo;the law of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo; the rule which He set
Himself, that in His earthly course He should minister to others,
bearing their infirmities, taking on Himself their burdens,
supplying their wants, binding up their wounds, healing their
sicknesses, and leaving us an example that we should follow his
steps; <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the
new commandment that we should love one another as He has loved
us, the exercise of that sympathy, for the working of which He
made of Himself and Christians one body, binding them to mutual
help and dependence, that &ldquo;whether one member suffer all
the members suffer with it, or one member be honoured all the
members rejoice with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man ever came into this world, certainly none was ever
incorporated in the Christian Church with license or power to
live to himself or by himself.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> has constituted us all in Him members
one of another.&nbsp; Faculties and gifts He has bestowed on
some, which cannot be used but in communicating to others; needs
He has created, and burdens imposed, for the relief of which men
must look to their brethren.&nbsp; Hence the richly endowed are
to hold their possessions in common, and to distribute them
liberally according as every man has need; hence the burden of
the suffering and oppressed is to be borne by the free.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here take of my good things,&rdquo; we are to say to the
needy, &ldquo;for <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>I hold them as a steward for thee.&nbsp; Here, give me of
thy evil things, for they are laid upon thee that I may take them
off or bear them with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, brethren, is the
law of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, a law to be observed as
holy duty, as blessed privilege, in the full measure of the
demand, or at least of the ability to meet it, in the spirit of
love.</p>
<p>We may not refuse when there is a cry for help, and we have it
to bestow; we may not plead another&rsquo;s liability to exempt
ourselves.&nbsp; We may not give just what we will, when more is
wanted, and we possess more, or can get it.&nbsp; We may not
excuse ourselves from further care, where our utmost effort has
failed to remove the oppressing load; we have then to add
<i>taking</i> to our <i>giving</i>, to go under the burden and
help to bear it.</p>
<p>Let these general remarks suffice to introduce and recommend
the special appeal which I have to make to you to-day on behalf
of your burdened brethren, the distressed operatives of
Lancashire.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>You know
their case.&nbsp; The blockade of the American harbours has
intercepted the large supply of cotton which till lately was
regularly received from thence.&nbsp; Consequently, the
mill-owners have either suspended work and closed their mills, or
have reduced the number of &ldquo;hands&rdquo; to a small
fraction of that usually employed.&nbsp; Thousands and thousands
of able, active, industrious men and women are thus, with their
families, deprived of the means of subsistence.&nbsp; Theirs is
not the case, remember, of men who <i>will</i> not work, and who,
therefore, according to the Apostolic rule, may justly be left to
bear their own burden: &ldquo;If any man will not work, neither
shall he eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; They want to work.&nbsp; They are
compelled to be idle; the door of the factory is shut against
them, and were they qualified for other kind of work, it could
not be found for them.&nbsp; What, then, is to be done for
them?&nbsp; And, who are to do it?&nbsp; There has been much
talk, as you probably know, about the backwardness of the
mill-owners generally to sustain the hands <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>which built up
their fortunes.&nbsp; An increased rate, or a loan upon the
rates, has been suggested.&nbsp; The intervention of Government
has been invoked.&nbsp; But while men are disputing about the
agency which ought to remove the burden, it is lying sore upon
those beneath it&mdash;it is crushing them to death!&nbsp; It is
true that &ldquo;private charity&rdquo; has done something;
according to the world&rsquo;s standard, has done
<i>much</i>.&nbsp; But, after all, the <i>present</i> emergency
has been mocked rather than met, and day by day the crowd of
sufferers is increasing, and the growing severity of the season
is intensifying their suffering.&nbsp; Surely, here is a demand
for the operation of the law of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Whoso seeth his brother in
<i>such</i> need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how
dwelleth the love of <span class="smcap">God</span> in him?&nbsp;
If <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, by and by, will reject with
indignation those who have left the <i>least</i> of his brethren
unfed, unclad, unvisited, how will He treat those who have
neglected these sufferers?&nbsp; For, assuredly, <i>they</i> are
not the &ldquo;least&rdquo; of His <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>brethren.&nbsp; It is no vicious or
imprudent course that has brought them to this pass.&nbsp; It is
the deliberate policy of our nation which has forced upon them,
all helpless, their grievous burden.&nbsp; It is what <i>we</i>
have done in self-love which has made <i>them</i>
miserable!&nbsp; And how nobly, how heroically, how religiously,
are they bending to the burden!&nbsp; There is no bitter outcry
against the blockaders, no intemperate act or speech against the
mill-owners, no riotous agitation for national intervention, no
lawless depredation, and desperate helping of themselves, no
clamour for relief, no greedy grasping of what is offered.&nbsp;
Their very failings lean to virtue&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; They have
struggled to be independent.&nbsp; They have drawn from the
savings&rsquo; bank the little fruits of their prudence and
frugality: &ldquo;one by one they have parted with their few
luxuries, their half-dozen books, and their musical instrument,
whatever it was; then the old clock ceased its familiar ticking;
then, lingeringly left behind, the old family Bible, with its
little family <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>record, and its many associations with the past; and
then their very clothing and bedding.&rdquo;&nbsp; While they
could help themselves, they would not ask, they would not
<i>have</i>, help from others, and even now, when all is gone,
the spirit of independence, the abhorrence of pauperism, the
desire to bear their own burden, will hardly let them receive, on
much persuasion and entreaty, the miserable pittance which is
called &ldquo;relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My brethren, shall such men with their wives and little ones
be hungry and naked, and lie on bare boards, and shiver, and
starve, and die, while we have aught of money, food, or raiment
that we can send them?</p>
<p>I should do you much wrong, if I feared that you would not
respond to such an appeal, if I did not feel confident that you
would make now the very largest offering you can, and go home
with the burning resolution to repeat it and surpass it if
possible.&nbsp; Your hearts must be touched, your hands must be
ready.&nbsp; You would not be <i>human</i>, much less
<i>Christian</i>, were it otherwise.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But,
brethren, zeal and love often burn themselves out without
affecting much around them, for want of direction and
management.</p>
<p>Let me, therefore, offer you a few practical suggestions
whereby you may be helped to sustain and make productive the
feelings now aroused.</p>
<p>Regard, then, the offering which you make to-day as the pledge
that you will give again and quickly, and at once set about
redeeming the pledge.&nbsp; Resolve to waste nothing, to spend
nothing on amusement, on luxuries, on what is not absolutely
necessary, till the hungry are all fed, and the naked all
clothed.&nbsp; Infuse the same spirit into your household and all
that approach it.&nbsp; Be a mouth to plead for those who will
not ask for themselves.&nbsp; Let no one meet you and part from
you without being stirred to respond to this most imperative
call.&nbsp; Hold out a ready and eager hand to receive what he
will give, and what you receive be prompt to hand on.</p>
<p>When you have scraped all that you can by direct means, look
about for by-ways.&nbsp; Part <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>with everything that you can do
without; ask your friend for the <i>cost</i> of his proffered
hospitality (be sure he will generally give you more); calculate
what you have saved by &ldquo;good&rdquo; bargains, and hand on
the gains.</p>
<p>These directions may seem trivial and the fruits which may
spring from their observance insignificant.&nbsp; But remember,
brethren, that where a loaf of bread may keep a fellow Christian
from starvation, there cannot really be anything trivial and
insignificant.</p>
<p>Besides, it is not merely the actual support for the body, but
the moral influence of manifested sympathy which has to be
considered.&nbsp; We have read how a kind word has lighted up a
careworn countenance and drawn forth the utterance, &ldquo;It
does us good to feel that we are cared for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
knows what the message of brotherly interest told by our smallest
offerings, blest by <span class="smcap">God</span>, may
effect?&nbsp; How it may arouse from despondency, how it may calm
the troubled breast, how it may cheer the last sad hours, and
prompt the wretched soul to bless <span class="smcap">God</span>
and us ere it depart!</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>And
this recalls to us another truth, that if we cannot remove the
burden, we may help to bear it.&nbsp; Let us make this our
concern.&nbsp; After all that we can do, there will, alas!
probably remain very much unrelieved.&nbsp; If we cannot take it
off, let us bear it up.&nbsp; If we cannot wipe away our
brother&rsquo;s tears, let us weep with him.&nbsp; If he must go
forth bearing the cross even unto death, let us bear it with him,
like Joseph of Arimathea, and give him the precious peace of
knowing that he is not alone.&nbsp; At the worst this shall keep
his soul alive while the body is perishing; it shall make him
walk calmly in the valley of the shadow of death; it shall bear
good fruit in eternity, if not in time.</p>
<p>One other brief suggestion on this head.&nbsp; Such an
interest and effort as I have urged upon you must, if you are
Christians, not only stretch forth your desires to your brother
Christian, but raise up your hearts to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Bear his burdens into the
presence of the <span class="smcap">God</span> that heareth
prayer.&nbsp; Tell out his wants, breathe your aspirations for
him before the throne of <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>grace.&nbsp; The prayer shall be
heard and answered.&nbsp; It shall return into your own bosom; it
shall enlist mighty intercession for you; if it does not keep
alive here, it shall save from death there.&nbsp; It shall people
heaven with expectants for your coming; with those who, when you
fail, shall joy to receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
